 LINCS Metadata Specifications:  http://www.lincsproject.org/data/data-standards/ 
 Small molecule information submitted by the LINCS Data and Signature Generation Centers (DSGCs) are standardized and registered by the Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC). The DCIC developed a standardization and registration pipeline to generate a unique chemical structure representation for each submitted record. The LINCS standardized small molecule IDs (SM_LINCS_ID) correspond to the standardized small molecule structures. Via the standardized chemical structure representation, LINCS compounds are mapped to PubChem CIDs and other external resources.
